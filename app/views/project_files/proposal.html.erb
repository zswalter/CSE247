<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
<p id="para">
The goal of this research project is to investigate the security vulnerabilities and privacy issues dealing with NFC technologies. </br>
</br>
NFC(Near Field Communications) is a growing technology for mobile devices.  One thing NFC is used for is credit card transactions at a cash register.   Another use for NFC is to share photos between devices.  With such personal data being transmitted by NFC devices there is a concern of oneâ€™s security and privacy. 

</p>

<h2>Proposed Methodology</h2>
<p id="para">
There will be an overview of the current NFC technologies and their current security and privacy implementations. This will be tested by simulating NFC transactions between devices and observing the security flaws. If there seems to be any kind of security flaw then it will be investigated. 
</p>

<h2>Expected Contributions</h2>
<p id="para">
The expected outcome of this research is to assure there is little to no privacy or security vulnerabilities while using NFC devices.  If there is a security flaw found, either try to find a reasonable fix for it or be able to educate about this issue to be further investigated.
